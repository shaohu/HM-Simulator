HM-Simulator is a software tool for simulating human motions. For each time of human movement, the step length and direction is randomly generated. Monte Carlo Simulation is used for controlling the over all distribution of step lengths. The distribution could be normal distribution, exponential distribution or power law (Levy flight). Other constrains are also considered during the simulation. Besides the simulation, data statistics and visualization components are provided by this software as well.

This is a desktop application written in Java and developed based on GeoTools.
