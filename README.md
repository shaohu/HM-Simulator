HM-Simulator is a software tool for simulating human motions. For each time of human movement, the step length and direction is randomly generated. Monte Carlo Simulation is used for controlling the 

It can generate synthetic trajectories with particular constrains, and analyze the patterns. It implements a number of well-known human mobility models including the Levy flight model

This is a desktop application written in Java and developed based on GeoTools.
